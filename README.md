# Semantic Segmenation of grapes using UNet Architecture

Used google colab for training of model

"Grapes-segmentation-unet.ipynb"

Steps for implementation:
1. Wine grapes dataset is available at https://github.com/thsant/wgisd
2. Uploading grapes-dataset.zip in Segmentation-grapes folder of google drive
3. Loading dataset to VM of google colab from google drive
4. Performing data preprocessing steps such as data augmentation and creating labels from masks
5. Creating UNet model and defining loss and metrics for training
6. Training model and saving weights back to google drive for further use
